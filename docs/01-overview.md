# Project Overview

## Mission
Create a lightweight, SMS-driven Volunteer Scheduler AI Agent (VSAI) that:
- Understands volunteer messages using natural language
- Manages availability, cancellations, and shift assignments
- Updates a simple schedule stored in Microsoft Lists
- Notifies staff automatically
- Requires no app or login for volunteers

## Guiding Principles
- Use only Microsoft tools
- Keep the architecture minimal
- Use free-tier or low-cost services
- Avoid custom backend code for the MVP
- Prioritize reliability and simplicity
